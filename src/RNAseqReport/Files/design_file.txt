# If library type is paired-end, a line of the design file correspond to a pair of fastq (eg in design file, # # the sample_ID column of ${samplename}.R1.fastq.gz and ${samplename}.R2.fastq.gz is ${samplename}).
# If library contains spikes, add "\_without_Spikes" at the end of sample_ID (indeed, spike's sequences are removed # from the raw fastq file and the new fastq file, without spikes, is called ${sample_ID}_noSpikes.fastq)
